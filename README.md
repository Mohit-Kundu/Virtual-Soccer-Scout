# Virtual Soccer Scout

The goal of this project was to build KNN models from scratch to match football (soccer) players with the perfect role on the field based on their FIFA skill ratings. By analyzing player attributes, this notebook demonstrates how KNN can predict and classify roles effectively.

## Features
- **KNN from Scratch**: A hands-on implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, step by step.
- **Player-Role Matching**: Matches players to ideal field roles based on their skills.
- **Data Exploration**: Clusters players to uncover patterns and similarities.
- **Clear Visualizations**: Illustrates model predictions and player groupings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohit-Kundu/Virtual-Soccer-Scout.git
   cd Virtual-Soccer-Scout
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook KNN_Fifa.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps to preprocess data, build the KNN model, and match players to roles.

For a deeper dive into the methodology, read my Medium article: [The Ultimate Beginner-Friendly Guide to Building a KNN model from scratch: FIFA Edition]([https://medium.com/@moh8.kundu/the-ultimate-beginner-friendly-guide-to-building-a-knn-model-from-scratch-fifa-edition-a0fc74f3c49d).

## Key Takeaways
- **Role Matching**: Assigns roles to players using skill ratings.
- **Clustering**: Identifies patterns in player attributes.
- **From-Scratch Approach**: Learn the internals of KNN by building it yourself.
